## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

## üß† What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned

---

### **1. Concept: Branching & Pull Requests**

**`Expectation`**: I assumed branches and pull requests were only needed in massive codebases with teams of developers. I expected to just push changes to `main` and be done.

**`Reality`**: Even as a solo dev, branching and PRs are essential! They gave me a clean workflow, let me organize features better, and made it easier to roll back mistakes.

**`Impact`**: I used a feature branch for each section of my portfolio ‚Äî homepage, about, projects, contact and merged them using PRs.

---

### **2. Concept: Merge Conflicts**

**`Expectation`**: I thought merge conflicts were rare, scary, and only happened when teams accidentally overwrote each other‚Äôs work.

**`Reality`**: Turns out conflicts are easy to trigger and if you don't plan your branches well, they pop up even when you're working alone.

**`Impact`**: I simulated a merge conflict on purpose by editing the same line in two branches. It forced me to understand how to manually resolve conflicts and clean up the mess.

---

### **3. Concept: GitHub Pages**

**`Expectation`**: I thought deploying a website would involve servers, domain settings, or complex devops stuff I wasn‚Äôt ready for.

**`Reality`**: GitHub Pages was surprisingly beginner-friendly. A few clicks in the repo settings and boom site was live!

**`Impact`**: My portfolio went live instantly after merging to `main`. Seeing my code live on the internet with a real URL made it feel official.

---

### **4. Concept: Git Project Boards**

**`Expectation`**: I thought project boards were overkill for a small one-person project like this. I expected to keep things in my head or on sticky notes.

**`Reality`**: Using Issues, Milestones, and a Project Board made everything clearer. It felt like I was managing a real product with features and deadlines.

**`Impact`**: I broke my project into trackable tasks, moved them across ‚ÄúTo Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done,‚Äù and it kept me focused from start to finish.

**Caption:** This shows the GitHub Project Board with columns for ‚ÄúTo do‚Äù, ‚ÄúIn progress‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDone.‚Äù Each issue was linked to the board for visual tracking of the development workflow.

---

### Pull Request with Rebase & Merge

![alt text](<Screenshot 2025-06-27 231749.png>)

**Caption:** This screenshot demonstrates how I used a pull request to merge a feature branch into `main` using the ‚ÄúRebase and merge‚Äù strategy to keep a clean and linear commit history.

###  Merge Conflict Alert

**Caption:** GitHub warning me about a merge conflict after attempting to merge two branches that edited the same line of code. This was part of the conflict simulation exercise.

**Caption:** This shows GitHub‚Äôs conflict editor interface where I manually resolved the conflict by selecting and cleaning the code before committing the fix.
